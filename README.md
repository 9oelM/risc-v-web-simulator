# risc-v-web-simulator

Yet another RISC-V Simulator on the web, for fun. Runs on Webassembly. Based on [Kite](https://github.com/yonsei-icsl/kite), RISC-V architecture simulator I used for my computer architecture class ([EEE3530](https://icsl.yonsei.ac.kr/eee3530/)) at Yonsei University. Turned it into Webassembly to use it on web. Again, it's just for fun. Lol.

## Todo
- cleanup duplicate css styles (now just copied and pasted cuz im lazy)
- responsive design for mobile environments
